# Project

Project is a node server and API for handling game data.

## Installation

Requires [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community). [PostMan](https://www.postman.com/) would help you send requests to the API.

You'll also need to install nodemon globally for the dev environment : 

```bash
npm install nodemon -g
```
Once that is setup, you can clone the repo in a folder and run
```bash
npm install
npm start => PROD
npm run dev => DEV (nodemon)
```

## Usage
Launch server, build requests and queries, build external tools that connect to it.
